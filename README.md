# SPD InfoZone – College Student Info Web App

SPD InfoZone is a simple and efficient web application built to help college staff manage student details with ease. Developed using Django, plain JavaScript, and MySQL Workbench, this system streamlines the process of viewing and updating student information.

Instead of manually entering data, student details are added through an Excel sheet. The app uses Pandas and a scheduled task that runs every hour to automatically update the database, so the latest information is always available.

Users can quickly search for student details by entering the batch, roll number, and department. It's fast, accurate, and makes finding the right information hassle-free.

Key Features:
Add and update student data via Excel sheet

Automatic hourly updates using Pandas

Search by batch, roll number, and department

Built with Django (backend), JS (frontend), and MySQL (database)

SPD InfoZone is built to save time, reduce manual work, and make student data accessible in just a few clicks — perfect for any college department that wants to go digital.
