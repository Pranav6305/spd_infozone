How to implement this project??


setup Django: 

-> refer w3schools website for creating a Django project [if u are creating a new project]


to clone this project:

-> use git clone <repo url> command in your vscode terminal 


to get database access:

-> modify the DATABASES section present in settings.py for fields such as database,username,password.

-> This project is implemented using MySQL workbench


In this project, we have connected excel sheet with MySQL workbench where when we make any changes in excel sheet it will get reflected in the database.

to get excel sheet access:

-> name the excel sheet as update_data with excel extension.

-> keep the excel sheet in onedrive so that changes gets updated.


to implement pandas code to keep the excel sheet updated:

-> find the path of python version "find the path of pandas code file[update_db.py]"
eg:C:\Python312\python "C:\Users\Pranavji\OneDrive\Documents\College_Coding\SPD\update_db.py"

-> run this command in command prompt to update the excel sheet present in onedrive.


After all this implementation, to run this project:

python manage.py runserver


Points to Note:

-> if you make any modifications and if it is not got updated, then run these commands:

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

-> if you face any error regarding adding or removing attributes, then 

fake the migration [get the command from chatGPT]

-> it is recommended to use GitHub repo for all projects as it's convenient to undo changes if necessary and to have different versions of the project. align this documentation.
